To use the updated functionality of the gene set enrichment method, the original package must be installed from Github. Once installed, the next step is to run the "gslrt_debugged_2_normal.R" file on R. This file defines the "gslrt2" function, which is similar to the original "gslrt" function but has the added capability to accept a continuous variable for z, instead of just binary.

To clarify, the first line of the "GSLRT-install-example.R" file on Github provides instructions for installing the original package. Once that is completed, the "gslrt_debugged_2_normal.R" file should be run to define the "gslrt2" function. This updated function allows for the analysis of continuous variables in gene set enrichment studies and is a useful tool for investigating complex biological mechanisms.
